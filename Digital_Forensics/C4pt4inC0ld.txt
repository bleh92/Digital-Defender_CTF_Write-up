There is no room on this planet for anything less than a miracle	      
We gather here today to revel in the rebellion of a silent tongue  	    
Every day, we lean forward into the light of our brightest designs & cherish the sun
Praise our hands & throats each incantation, a jubilee of a people dreaming wildly
Despite the dirt beneath our feet or the wind pushing against our greatest efforts
Soil creates things Art births change	       	       	       	     	  
This is the honey  	 	     	 	 	      	   	      
& doesn’t it taste like a promise?   	  	       	  	 	     
The password is azrael 	       	   		  	      	     	      
Where your heart is an accordion 	    		       	       	       
& our laughter is a soundtrack   		 	 	       	  
Friend, dance to this good song—       	     	      	      	    
look how it holds our names!	   	   	  	   	    	     
Each bone of our flesh-homes sings welcome      	      	   	     
O look at the Gods dancing    	       	    	     
as the rain reigns against a steely skyline
Where grandparents sit on the porch & nod at the spectacle
in awe of the perfection of their grandchildren’s faces
Each small discovery unearthed in its own outpour
Tomorrow our daughters will travel the world with each poem
       & our sons will design cities against the backdrops of living museums
       Yes! Our children will spin chalk until each equation bursts a familial tree
